### momentum
![momentum](images/momentumsketch.png?raw=true "momentum")

For my first project, I created a piece called "momentum". I started working on this piece after coming home from a yoga class during which the teacher encouraged us to think about what gives us "momentum". In other words, she wanted us to reflect on what keeps us going on hard days and what encourages us to push ourselves to reach our goals. When reflecting on this idea, I immediately thought of a list that I keep on my computer with my favorite inspirational quotes. I consult this list whenever I need some extra motivation and add to it when I come across worthy quotes. Therefore, I started by choosing three of my favorite quotes to highlight in this project, and decided on the quotes by Martin Luther King Jr., Melinda Gates, and Margaret Mead. It was especially fitting to include a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From a Birmingham Jail" given the recent holiday.

I chose a light purple color for the background and light green, pink, and yellow colors for the quotes because they are all calming to me. I added "Keep moving forward..." in a forward motion at the top of the sketch as a reminder that sums up what this piece means to me. I added stars to the top lefthand corner because I thought of the idea of wishing on shooting stars for your dreams to come true. Finally, I added a bit of interaction to my sketch by writing an 'if else' statement for the images at the center. Even though they're cliche, I love the words "dream", "love", "hope", "believe", and "faith". I included images with these words to further remind myself what keeps me going on hard days. When the mouse is clicked, the image switches from the words "dream", "love", "hope", "believe" to "Faith Hope & Love."

In summary, this sketch is a representation of my personal "momentum" and I know that on tough days, I'll go back to it as a reminder to "Keep moving forward."
